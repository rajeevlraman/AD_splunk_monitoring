            <p>1. Objectives
                •	Understand the overall goal of setting up a virtualized Active Directory environment.
                •	Create a logical network diagram to plan your AD setup.
                2. Creating a Logical Diagram
                •	Tools Needed:
                o	Use tools like Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, or draw.io to create your network diagram.
                •	Design Your Network:
                o	Plan the placement of each virtual machine (VM), such as Windows Server (Domain Controller), Windows 10 (client), Kali Linux, and Ubuntu Server.
                o	Include network elements like the router, switch, and IP addressing scheme.
                •	Diagram Elements:
                o	Represent each VM with icons and label them appropriately (e.g., DC for Domain Controller).
                o	Draw connections to represent how the VMs will communicate within the network.
                •	Save and Document:
                o	Save your diagram as a reference throughout the project.
                o	Document the network topology and the purpose of each VM in the setup.
                3. Hardware Requirements
                •	Minimum Specifications:
                o	Processor: Multi-core processor (Intel i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen 5/7).
                o	Memory: At least 16 GB of RAM (32 GB recommended for better performance).
                o	Storage: SSD with at least 200 GB of free space.
                •	VMWare/VirtualBox Requirements:
                o	Ensure your host machine supports virtualization (check BIOS settings).
                o	Install the latest version of VMware or VirtualBox to manage your VMs.
                •	Network Configuration:
                o	Plan for a network interface card (NIC) that supports multiple virtual network adapters.
                o	Configure network settings for internal and external communication within your VM environment.
